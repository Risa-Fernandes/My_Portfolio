PROFILE IMAGE PLACEHOLDER
=========================

Instructions for adding your profile photo:

1. Save your profile photo in this 'assets' folder
2. Recommended formats: .jpg, .png, .webp
3. Recommended size: 150x150 pixels (square)
4. Rename it to: profile.jpg (or profile.png)

5. Update the <img> tag in your HTML file:

   FROM:
   <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Profile Photo">

   TO:
   <img src="../assets/profile.jpg" alt="Your Name - Profile Photo">

Tips for a good profile photo:
- Use a clear, professional headshot
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep the background simple
- Smile!

Note: The placeholder images in the code use https://via.placeholder.com
which generates temporary placeholder images. Replace these with your
actual photos before deploying.
